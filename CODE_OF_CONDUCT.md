## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and taking appropriate, fair action in response to any unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and public spaces when representing the project or community. Examples include using an official project email, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a representative at events.

## Reporting and Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported by contacting the project team at [dzedou@chronorogues.com].
