In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Behaviors that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Demonstrating empathy towards others.

Behaviors that are not acceptable include:

- Trolling, insults, and derogatory comments or personal attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit consent.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and taking appropriate, fair action in response to any unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and public spaces when representing the project or community. Examples include using an official project email, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a representative at events.

## Reporting and Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported by contacting the project team at [contact@example.com]. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Maintainers are expected to maintain confidentiality regarding reporters and take appropriate corrective action.
